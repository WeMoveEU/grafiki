Some useful SDK commands:

* atlas-run   -- installs this plugin into a local Confluence deployment and starts it on localhost
* atlas-package -- Rebuild this plugin and hotswap it on the running server
* atlas-debug -- same as atlas-run, but allows a debugger to attach at port 5005
* atlas-help  -- prints description for all commands in the SDK
